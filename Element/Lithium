<h1> Lithium</h1>
<body> 
<p> Lithium’s name is derived from the Greek word ‘lithos’, which means ‘stone.’ Lithium was first discovered by Johan Arfvedson in 1817 in Stockholm, Sweden, during an analysis of petalite (LiAlSi4O10). He found the petalite contained “silica, alumina and an alkali. The new alkali metal in the petalite had unique properties. It required more acid to neutralize it than sodium and its carbonate was only sparingly soluble in water unlike sodium carbonate. The new alkali differed also from potassium because it did not give a precipitate with tartaric acid. The pure metal was isolated the following year by both Swedish chemist William Brande and English chemist Humphry Davy working independently. Davy obtained a small quantity of lithium metal by electrolysis of lithium carbonate. By 1855 Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen were independently producing the metal in large quantities by electrolysis of molten lithium chloride. </p>
